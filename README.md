# 2020-Fun_Race_3d_SpeedTest
 
 I’ve spent approximately 4:30 hours in order to do the desired test. I’m not that proud of the result because I think I could do it much better.
The most difficult part for me was the player’s movement setup. I’ve spent too much time trying to figure out the math behind its movement. I’m a bit rusty with the vectorial math. 
A lot of things could be done better:
- The code structure is not the best I can do, by far, however I’m not used to work with souch finite amount of time.
- The camera animation system should be expanded in order to make the camera able to do other motions. 
- The player movement and rotation. I would need more time in order to check the math required for the object to follow the waypoints rotating its forward vector in a smooth way.
Well, in order to improve the game, some things could be done:
- Add sounds to the game: Right now half of the primary sensory inputs of the player are not being used at all.
- Add vibration to the game. 
- Add adaptations to the game to make it playable for people with disabilities. 
- Develop a procedural level generation system in order to create infinite levels categorized by difficulty.
- Create more types of “traps” in order to make the game more dynamic.
- Create levels located on different biomes: That could make the game look better and maybe attract more people of its target audience.
- Create ways for the players to interact with each other: Right now the playing experience, while being shared with other players, is singleplayer. I say that because the actions of the player A can not affect the actions of the player B. It could be interesting to make the players able to make the game harder for the other online players of the same level (activating traps for example).
- Alternative paths. It might be interesting for the game to have multiple paths to the end goal. More paths = More options = More replayability.

Have a nice day if you are reading this 

EDIT: This project is not perfect AT ALL and should only be seen as an example of what I'm able to do with a time frame of 4 and a half hours. Neither the systems nor the architecture of the project should be taken as an example of "good practice". It does have some good things but those are few in comparison with the things I would do differently in this project.

This project does show what I can make work with limited time and not how I would make a game if the clarity and quality of the code was the first priority.
